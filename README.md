Bikeshare Data Exploration (CLI)

### Description
This project is a command-line Python program that explores bikeshare data and prints summary statistics.

- Most common travel times (month, day, hour)
- Most popular stations (start, end, and combinations)
- Trip duration statistics
- User info (where available)

### Files used
- `bikeshare.py` — main Python script
- `new_york_city.csv` — dataset file (stored locally; ignored by git)
- `.gitignore` — excludes the dataset from being committed

### How to run
Run the program from the command line:

```bash
python3 bikeshare.py
